# Smart Budgeting Techniques

Creating and maintaining a budget is the cornerstone of financial health. The 50/30/20 rule provides a simple framework: allocate 50% of after-tax income to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings and debt repayment. Track every expense for at least one month to understand your spending patterns. Use budgeting apps or spreadsheets to categorize expenses and identify areas for potential savings. Automate bill payments and savings transfers to ensure consistency. Review and adjust your budget monthly, treating it as a living document that evolves with your financial situation.
