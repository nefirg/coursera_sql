# Ludwig van Beethoven

Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) stands as one of the most influential composers in the history of Western classical music, whose revolutionary works bridged the Classical and Romantic periods. Despite beginning to lose his hearing in his late twenties and becoming almost completely deaf by his forties, Beethoven composed some of the most celebrated symphonies in musical history, including the triumphant Symphony No. 3 "Eroica," the fate-knocking Symphony No. 5 with its iconic four-note motif, the pastoral Symphony No. 6, and the monumental Symphony No. 9 "Choral" featuring the "Ode to Joy." His profound deafness, which he described as his greatest torment, paradoxically drove him to compose with even greater intensity and innovation, pushing the boundaries of musical form and emotional expression. Beethoven's impact on classical music cannot be overstated—he expanded the scope and ambition of the symphony, elevated the status of instrumental music to equal that of vocal music, and paved the way for the Romantic era by emphasizing personal expression and breaking free from classical constraints, forever changing how composers approached their craft and how audiences experienced music.
