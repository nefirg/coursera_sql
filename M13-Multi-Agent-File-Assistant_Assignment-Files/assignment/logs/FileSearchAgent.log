Your job
is to search for files
    that match a given query by examining their contents.
    
    When given a directory and search query, follow these steps:
    [1;36m1[0m. Use list_dir to list all files in the directory
    [1;36m2[0m. For each file found, use read_file to read its contents
    [1;36m3[0m. Check if the file content is relevant to the search query
    [1;36m4[0m. Keep track of all files that match the query
    
    A file matches if:
    - It contains keywords from the query
    - Its content is related to the query topic
    - It has information relevant to what the user is looking for
    
    Be thorough in your search and check all files in the directory.
    
    When you find matching files, use `done_tool` to return your results.
    In the `content` field, provide:
    - The names of files that match the query
    - A brief explanation of WHY each file matches [1m([0mwhat relevant content it contains[1m)[0m
    - Format your response clearly with each file on its own line
    
    IMPORTANT: If no files match, use `done_tool` with content = EMPTY string!

Ludwig van Beethoven [1m([0m[1;36m1770[0m-[1;36m1827[0m[1m)[0m stands as one of the most influential composers in the history of Western classical music, whose revolutionary works bridged the Classical and Romantic periods. 
Despite beginning to lose his hearing in his late twenties and becoming almost completely deaf by his forties, Beethoven composed some of the most celebrated symphonies in musical history, including 
the triumphant Symphony No. [1;36m3[0m [32m"Eroica,"[0m the fate-knocking Symphony No. [1;36m5[0m with its iconic four-note motif, the pastoral Symphony No. [1;36m6[0m, and the monumental Symphony No. [1;36m9[0m [32m"Choral"[0m featuring the [32m"Ode to [0m
[32mJoy."[0m His profound deafness, which he described as his greatest torment, paradoxically drove him to compose with even greater intensity and innovation, pushing the boundaries of musical form and 
emotional expression. Beethoven's impact on classical music cannot be overstatedâ€”he expanded the scope and ambition of the symphony, elevated the status of instrumental music to equal that of vocal 
music, and paved the way for the Romantic era by emphasizing personal expression and breaking free from classical constraints, forever changing how composers approached their craft and how audiences 
experienced music.[1m[[0m[35m/[0m[95mred[0m[1m][0m

Destiny's Child, she has amassed an unprecedented [1;36m32[0m Grammy Awards, making her the most decorated artist in Grammy history. Her musical evolution has been nothing short of revolutionary, transitioning
from R&B pop anthems like [32m"Crazy in Love"[0m to groundbreaking visual albums such as [32m"Lemonade"[0m [1m([0m[1;36m2016[0m[1m)[0m and [32m"Renaissance"[0m [1m([0m[1;36m2022[0m[1m)[0m, which explored themes of Black womanhood, infidelity, and healing while 
pushing sonic boundaries through house, disco, and Afrobeats. Beyond her musical achievements, BeyoncÃ© has redefined the role of the modern pop star as a cultural architect, using her platform to 
champion Black culture, feminism, and social justice through powerful performances like her [1;36m2018[0m Coachella set [1m([0mdubbed [32m"Beychella"[0m[1m)[0m and her politically charged Super Bowl halftime show in [1;36m2016[0m. Her

Bill Evans [1m([0m[1;36m1929[0m-[1;36m1980[0m[1m)[0m was a revolutionary jazz pianist whose introspective approach and harmonic sophistication fundamentally transformed the landscape of modern jazz piano. Best known for his 
groundbreaking work with his trioâ€”particularly the legendary collaboration with bassist Scott LaFaro and drummer Paul Motianâ€”Evans pioneered a conversational, democratic approach to trio playing 
where all three instruments engaged as equal partners rather than the traditional piano-with-accompaniment format. His harmonic innovations included the extensive use of modal jazz concepts, rootless 
voicings, and impressionistic chord clusters that drew from classical composers like Debussy and Ravel, creating a uniquely lyrical and emotionally profound sound. Evans' influence on subsequent 
generations of jazz pianists cannot be overstated; his emphasis on touch, tone, and the creative use of space, combined with his sophisticated reharmonizations and introspective interpretations of 
standards, established a new paradigm for jazz piano that continues to inspire players worldwide, from Keith Jarrett and Herbie Hancock to Brad Mehldau and beyond.[1m[[0m[35m/[0m[95mred[0m[1m][0m

Creating and maintaining a budget is the cornerstone of financial health. The [1;36m50[0m/[1;36m30[0m/[1;36m20[0m rule provides a simple framework: allocate [1;36m50[0m% of after-tax income to needs, [1;36m30[0m% to wants, and [1;36m20[0m% to savings and
debt repayment. Track every expense for at least one month to understand your spending patterns. Use budgeting apps or spreadsheets to categorize expenses and identify areas for potential savings. 
Automate bill payments and savings transfers to ensure consistency. Review and adjust your budget monthly, treating it as a living document that evolves with your financial situation.[1m[[0m[35m/[0m[95mred[0m[1m][0m

investments in your future when managed responsibly.[1m[[0m[35m/[0m[95mred[0m[1m][0m

Understanding investment basics is crucial for building long-term wealth. Begin with the fundamental principle of risk versus reward - higher potential returns typically come with increased risk. 
Diversification across asset classes like stocks, bonds, and real estate helps minimize portfolio volatility. Dollar-cost averaging, where you invest fixed amounts regularly regardless of market 
conditions, can reduce the impact of market timing. Always research investments thoroughly, understand fees and expenses, and maintain an emergency fund before investing. Remember that investing is a 
marathon, not a sprint.[1m[[0m[35m/[0m[95mred[0m[1m][0m
